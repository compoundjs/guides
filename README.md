#### [Crash course][crash-course]

This is a quick course on CompoundJS. It walks you through creating your first app and will help you learn the basic structure and use
of the powerful CompoundJS generators and tools.

#### [Elements Explained][elements-explained]

Take a closer look at CompoundJS elements; each fulfills its own
function. This guide teaches you how to use each part of CompoundJS and bundle
those parts together to create awesome applications.

### CompoundJS Essentials

#### [Routing][routing]

Draw your application's routing map in a few expressions. This guide

#### [Controllers][controllers]

Everything you need to know about controllers and the request handling flow:
actions, hooks, and the middleware stack.

#### [Models][models]
Brief guide with some examples and advice for JugglingDB starters. This is not a

used in CompoundJS.

#### [View/layouts Rendering][views]

Views, layouts, templating engines and all related stuff (except helpers,
because helpers are a big theme worthy of a separate guide).

#### [View Helpers][helpers]

Everything about built-in and custom-made helpers.
Learn how to create your own helpers and helper-related techniques to simplify

### Advanced topics

#### [Meta-programming][meta-controllers]

Short guide about meta-programming techniques that could be used to apply DRY to controllers and
reuse controller code.

#### [Events, Compound API][events-api]

Learn how to use events to hook up particular application loading stages. Then
use API methods to configure CompoundJS for your application needs.

#### [Building Extensions][extensions-api]

Let's see how to extend CompoundJS and make your code reusable using the extensions
